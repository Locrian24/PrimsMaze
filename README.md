# PrimsMaze
Basic maze generator using prim's algorithm. 
Can generate up to 500x500 pixel maze images (more possible but computation time is exponential)
    - All images are created as a square maze

prim.py is the main file and should be the one that is run in the console:

python3 prim.py <pixel_dimension> <name_of_image_file.png>
