# PrimsMaze
Basic pixel maze generator using prim's algorithm. 

Can generate up to 500x500 pixel maze images (more possible but computation time is exponential)
    - All images are created as a square maze

prim.py is the main file and should be the one that is run in the console:
```
python3 prim.py <name_of_image>.png <pixel_dimension>
```
